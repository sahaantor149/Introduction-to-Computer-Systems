# Introduction to Computer Systems Projects

This repository contains a collection of C programming projects completed during my first trimester at United International University (UIU) for the course *Introduction to Computer Systems*. Over 12 classes, I developed various programs that helped me understand basic programming concepts and computational logic.

## Projects Included

The programs cover a range of foundational topics, including:

1. **Number Properties** - Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. **Area Calculations** - Calculate the area of a circle and a rectangle based on user input.
3. **Cube Calculation** - Compute the cube of a given integer.
4. **Currency Conversion** - Convert Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) to USD or EUR.
5. **Odd or Even Check** - Determine if a number is odd or even.
6. **Factorial Calculation** - Calculate the factorial of a number using a loop.
7. **Grade Assignment** - Assign grades based on marks input by the user.
8. **Find Largest Number** - Identify the largest number among three inputs.
9. **Leap Year Check** - Check if a given year is a leap year.
10. **Prime Number Check** - Determine if a number is prime.
11. **Reverse Number** - Reverse the digits of an integer.
12. **Temperature Converter** - Convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
13. **Character Check** - Identify if a character is a vowel or consonant.
14. **Simple Arithmetic** - Basic programs for addition, squaring, and swapping values.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these programs, you need:
- A C compiler, such as GCC.
- A terminal or IDE like Visual Studio Code or Code::Blocks.

### How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Introduction-to-Computer-Systems.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Introduction-to-Computer-Systems
3. Compile the C file you want to run.
